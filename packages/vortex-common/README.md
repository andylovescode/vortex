# Vortex Common

A library of common utilities and functions for the Vortex project.

As a developer of Vortex applications, you will not need to use this library directly.
It is used internally by Vortex and its related libraries, for the sake of reducing bundle size and not forcing developers to copy paste helpers from one library to another.
