# Vindicator

Vercel's Build Output API is quite possible the most poorly documented, unintuitive, and downright frustrating protocol I've ever had the displeasure of working with. Vindicator is my attempt to make it a little less painful.

## What does it do?

Vindicator takes nice, clean steps for your routing code, and converts them into the bizarre, convoluted JSON format that Vercel expects.

Polar is to Stripe as Vindicator is to Vercel's Build Output API.
