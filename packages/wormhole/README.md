# Wormhole

Wormhole is the metaframework for Vortex, providing an opinionated way to build applications with Vortex.

## What it is

- The reccommended way to build applications with Vortex.
- What we believe is the best way to structure applications
- Provides a set of tools that synergize with said reccommended structure

## Who this isn't for

- People who don't want to use Vortex
- People who are trying to build local-first applications, it's possible, but then you're barely using any of the features of the framework, probably just use Vortex with Vite.
- People who don't like magic. We try to create magic that isn't too confusing, but if compiler features aren't your cup of tea, this isn't for you.
